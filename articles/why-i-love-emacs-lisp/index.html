    <h1>Surprisingly productive</h1>
    When I start a process in emacs, I navigate to the (start-process
    ...) sexp and type c-x c-e.  The process starts and dumps stdout to
    a buffer of my choosing.  I haven't had to leave my text editor
    and I can navigate through the output with the full power of emacs
    (copy/paste, searching, saving, etc...).<br><br>
    If I want to kill the process I navigate to the (delete-process
    ...) sexp and type c-x c-e. The process terminates.<br><br>
    I can save these sexp in a file that makes it easy for me to store
    and retrieve my "control board".<br><br>
    All of this is accomplished without lifting my fingers off the
    keyboard.
