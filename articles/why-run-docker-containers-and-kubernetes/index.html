    If your development team is growing and adding new departments/teams, your
    codebase probably is growing too.  In order to remain agile, you may
    find microservices offer advantages to a large codebase and a
    plurality of teams.
    
    <H3>Benefits of microservices</H3>
    <ol>
      <li>Code can be broken out into smaller microservices that are easier to
        learn, release and update.</li>
      <li>Individual microservices can be written using the best tools for the
        job.</li>
      <li>Releasing a new service doesn't require
        synchronization across a whole company.</li>
      <li>New technology stacks have lower risk since the service
        is relatively small.</li>
      <li>Developers can run containers locally, rebuilding and verifying
        after each commit on a system that mirrors production.</li>
      <li>Both Docker and Kubernetes are open source and free to
        use.</li>
      <li>Access to Docker hub leverages the work of the opensource
        community.</li>
      
      <li>Service isolation without the heavyweight VM.  Adding a
        service to a server does not affect other services on the
        server.</li>
      <li>Services can be more easily run on a large cluster of nodes making it
        more reliable.</li>
      <li>Some clients will only host in private and not
        on public clouds.</li>
      <li>Lends itself to immutable infrastructure, so services are
        reloadable without missing state when a server goes down.</li>
      <li>Immutable containers improve security since data can only be mutated in specified
        volumes, root kits often can't be installed even if the system is
        penetrated.</li>
      <li>Increasing support for new hardware, like the GPU in a
      container means even gpgpu tasks like deep learning can be
        containerized.</li>
    </ol>

    There is a cost for running microservices - the build and
    runtime becomes more complex.  This is part of the price to pay
    and if you've made the right decision in your context, then benefits
    will exceed the costs.
    
    <H3>Costs of microservices</H3>
    <ol>
      <li>Managing multiple services tends to be more costly.</li>
      <li>New ways for network and servers to fail.</li>
    </ol>
