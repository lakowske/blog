  <h3>Conscious cosmos and personal reality</h3>
  <p>
    Relations between consciousness the physical world and personal
    reality are put forward.
  </p>
  <p>
    Imagine a cosmos without consciousness.  Without
    consciousness, there are no observation of changes within the
    universe. Without observations, time passes instantaneously.
  </p>
  <p>
    Individuals experience instantaneous passage
    of time (i.e. change) in multiple ways.  A dreamless sleep where the changing clock beside their
    bed reads 11PM in one moment and then 6AM the next.  During anesthesia, where consciousness
    is not present for many hours (e.g. 8-12 hrs for long
    operations) and the person wakes as though an instant later, except
    their body has been changed.  From the begining, a person can observe that
    when they became conscious, they didn't
    wait billions of years for the evolution of the comos, they awoke into the form they inhabit now.
    These are examples of the instantaneous passage of time.
