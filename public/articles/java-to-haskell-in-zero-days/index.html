    <h2>Java to Haskell in Zero Days</h2>

    <p>
      Haskell is a language that is foreign to most programmers coming
      from an imperitive language like Java, C#, C++, Python and the
      like.  You find new concepts that make learning Haskell feel
      like learning your first imperitive language.  The first step is
      to acknowledge this, so you don't get frustrated right away when
      you aren't productive immediately.  This acknowledgment allowed
      me to pass through many frustrating moments trying to do
      something useful.  I realized, I wasn't trying to write a web
      service, I was trying to learn haskell by way of writing a web
      service.

      If you're a productive Java or C# developer and learning
      Haskell, you might at times find yourself a little hazy on some
      of the concepts and terminology.  This document is meant to
      clear up confusion by using terminology you are familiar
      with to describe Haskell's terminology and syntax.

    <H2>Learn Haskell by picking a toy application you enjoy</H2>

    Maybe you like to chain together processes, or write algorithms.
    Whatever it is, do that so that you have some fun at the end of
    each struggle.  Bite off small toy problems, and when you get too
    ambitious, scale back and bite off something smaller.  When you're
    stuck for hours, you know it's time to scale back and pick a smaller
    topic within you're toy problem domain to learn.

<h3>Haskell documentation</h3>

<p>
Haskell documentation is found on hackage.  After some time you'll
be able to read the definitions.  Sometimes the author has documented
their package well with examples.  Until you're more familiar, you'll
be better off learning the fundamentals, so go <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com">learn you a haskell</a>.
