    <p>
      This is a story about how I came to live on a solar powered
      boat.  I had a dream of powering my life with solar power for
      over a decade.  I started with my home in Sun Prairie, WI.  The
      plan was to add a large array to the property and sell the power
      back to the grid, but 'smart' net metering made it so that there was no
      longer a way to run the electric meter backwards.  It took away
      my incentive to overbuild, but that didn't stop me from wanting
      to power my life with solar.  I knew I'd need a battery to store
      the excess power rather than pushing it out onto the grid.
