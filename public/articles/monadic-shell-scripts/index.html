      Shell scripts can be monad like in their construction.  When
      shell scripts are chained together with pipes, you get a sense
      of their composability. I'll walk you through a few examples to
      give you a concrete example of this composability.

      Copies my .ssh directory to a remote computer
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-bash">(cd /home/seth ; tar -cf - .ssh) | ssh seth@sethlakowske.com -c tar -xf -</code></pre>

    <p>
      tar is amazing! It maps a local filesystem to a stream that we can
      send to stdout, or in this case across the internet! At the
      other end of the pipe, tar maps our stream to the
      other local filesystem.  Many programs
      use the filesystem as their environment, reading config files
      /etc, ~/.ssh or wherever.  If you have a program that
      only relies on the filesystem, add tar then your
      program can take a stream as input too!

        (cd /home/seth ; tar -cf - .ssh) | ssh seth@sethlakowske.com -c tar -xf -
        alias k8s-keys='docker run -i lakowske/k8s-keys'
        alias tout='tar -cf -'
        alias tin='tar -xf -'
