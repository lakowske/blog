    <p>
      My goal is to use one language across two environments, the
      server and the browser.  I want to do so easily and I have
      attempted to achieve this in the past, but ran into
      difficulties.
    </p>
    <h2>Requirejs:</h2>
    <p>
      I tried Requirejs on the server and browser.  I thought the API was
      unnatural relative to CommonJS, but if it got me to my goal of
      shared Javascript, I would accept it as a cost of commonality.
      Additional cost crept in, I started managing a Requirejs
      configuration script, which started simple, but became more
      unweildy as I "shimed" various libraries that I wanted to
      require in my project.  Some libraries didn't shim right,
      befuddled I spent hours searching google for how to get
      library X to work with Requirejs.  I didn't like spending time
      debugging my tools.  This was supposed to be easy.
    </p>
    <h2>Browserify:</h2>
    <p>
      My initial exposure to Browserify was while I was writing a
      Backbone application and testing with Mocha and Sinon.  These
      libraries were not written as CommonJS modules - the
      native module system of Nodejs.  As a consequence, there was no
      guarantee they would work well with Browserify.  At the time, I was more concerned
      with these libraries than my module system, so I choose to go with
      Requirejs.  While the pains of Requirejs started to build, I
      kept reading about people using Browserify.  I was also becoming
      more familiar with Nodejs and its pipe API, which I am fond
      of from my Unix experience.  When I learned the power of pipes
      and streams was available in the browser via Browserify, I
      decided to give Browserify another try.
    <p>
      So far, Browserify is working well - it lets me use the
      pipe API I love in Nodejs.  Other Nodejs modules are available
      also.  When I write a new module, I can write it in typical
      Nodejs fashion and I feel comfortable knowing it will work in
      the browser and Nodejs. I switched my unit test
      library from Karma to Tape.  Tape is written by substack, the
      same person who created Browserify, so of course it works with
      Browserify.  I finally feel like I have a tool that allows me to
      write code for nodejs and the browser.  Most importantly, it is
      easy to use and comprehend.  I haven't had to put much thought
      into shared code in a while, which is exactly how I like it!
