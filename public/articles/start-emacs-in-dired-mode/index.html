      You can start emacs in dired mode by adding this to your startup script

      <pre><code>

	  (dired ".")
	  
      </code></pre>

      Next time you start emacs, the dired command will run,
      <b>starting emacs in dired mode</b> at the current working directory.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another way to start emacs in dired mode, is to execute an expression from the command
      line, e.g.

      <pre><code>

	  emacs --execute='(dired "~/")'

      </code></pre>

      This starts emacs and executes the dired command, <b>starting emacs in dired mode</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      Lastly, a simple way is to just pass the directory to emacs, e.g.

      <pre><code>

	  emacs .

      </code></pre>

      <b>Starting emacs in dired mode</b> at the current working directory.
