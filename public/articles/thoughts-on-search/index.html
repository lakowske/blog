    <H2>Searching and APIs</H2>
    <ul>
      <li>
	<H3>APIs that are a subset of search</H3>
        Often an API is a subset of search.  Anytime a user of the API
        gets a list of items back matching some criteria, it might
        simply be a search query masquerading as an API call.  One can
        turn search queries into an API call.  For example, give me all
        objects that were created on day X (date: xx/yy/zzzz) could be
        <pre><code class="language-java">List&ltObjectType&gt getObjectsCreatedOn(Date someDay)</code></pre>
        So we know that some API calls have a corresponding search query.
      </li>
      <li>
        <H3>One search API vs many equivalent API calls</H3>
        One can therefore reduce many equivalent API calls to a single
        search API.  One still needs typing for the search result
        objects and potentially transforming objects from a serialized
        form to a reiffied form (e.g. bytes -> plain old objects).
