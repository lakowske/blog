    <H2>Why trading</H2>
    <ul>
      <li>
	<H3>Direct immediate market feedback</H3>
	I've worked jobs where your work is not judged by the market,
	but instead a bureaucracy.  It's hard to know if what you're
	doing is of value and to what degree.  The public markets on the
	other hand give immediate feedback in the form of trading gains/losses.
      </li>
      <li>
	<H3>Closer to the truth</H3>
	Markets can be irrational, but a well run market tends toward the truth over
	time.  I'd like to help push the markets toward the truth, with
	the best information I can find and best analysis I can make.

	My first foray into markets was learning a principled value
	investing approach as a touchstone to the true value of an
	asset.  I want to delve deeper now and learn about short term
	market mania.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <H2>Lessons learned</H2>
    <p>
      This is a story about the lessons learned as I began intra-day trading.
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
	<H3>Emotions</H3><br>
	Trading to support a person's livelihood involves the gain and loss of meaningful amounts
	of money.  When a trade is placed and meaningful amounts of
	money can be gained or lost, traders can be susceptible to swings in
	emotion.  Swings in emotions tend to create biases unrelated
	to the underlying information in the market.<br>The risk with gains is an emotional bias of
	over confidence with the implied assumption
	that good market conditions will continue.  This can
	result in over-betting just when good conditions
	are plateauing and starting to recede.<br>The risk with losses is an emotional bias of lack of confidence
	with the implied assumption that bad conditions will continue.  This can result in under-betting just when
	good conditions are arising.  It's important to learn to keep a loose grip, or have some detachment while recognizing
	emotions as they occur.  It's import to be watchful and vigilant in the face of large gains or losses.
      </li>
      <li>
        <H3>Greed</H3><br>
	When a trader starts out profitable enough on the day to stop trading,
	emotions like greed tempt traders to continue trading.  Greed
	also crops up when a trader starts out with a loss and will
	not accept the pain of taking a loss on the day and continues
	to trade no matter the conditions.  The
	naive idea being that the trading is profitable and so the
	more trading, the more profits will be made.  This is incorrect
	due to decision fatigue explained below and market conditions.
	Quality trading decisions are finite and low quality
	decisions made later in the day tend to result in less
	profit.
      </li>
      <li>
        <H3>Decision fatigue</H3><br>
	Humans lose their ability to make good decisions as the number
	of decisions increases throughout a day due to mental fatigue. Trading involves
	making decisions such as whether a good
	setup to buy or sell is present.   As the number of trading
	decisions made per day increases, fatigue sets in, trades
	tend to become more inconsistent and sloppy.
      </li>

      <li>
        <H3>Learning the setups</H3><br>
        Traders have a lingua franca regarding common states of the market that
        are referred to as setups, plays or market events. Some common setups are
        symmetric triangles, gap-n-go, bull flag, bear flag, etc...
        It's worth learning these to get an idea of stereotypical
        concluding moves or outcomes (i.e. resolutions).
      </li>

      <li>
	<H3>The necessity of volatility</H3><br>
	Market setups don't work without volatility(price change).  A market event
	might occur (e.g. a gap-down), but if there isn't any
	subsequent price movement, neither a short or a long position will profit.
	So volatility is necessary.  If nothing is changing in the
	market, neither your balance sheet nor any
	other participants balance sheet can change.  The constant
	need, greed and fear of market participants (e.g. stock
	buyers, home buyers, car purchasers, etc...) tends to keep
	markets moving with some degree of volatility.
      </li>

      <li>
        <H3>Avoiding the big loss</H3><br>
        <p>
        Beginner traders may have periods of consistent profits, but
        due to a hole in their trading plan, give up profits with a
        big loss.  The big losses tend to stem from
        emotional decision making, rather than sticking to a planned
        exit.  Occasionally fat fingering (mistakenly placing or
        leaving an order) is the cause, though these are perhaps 1 in
        50 events vs. emotional trades.  The emotion tends to
        be a fear of being wrong, fear of taking a loss, or clinging
        to a bias.
        </p>
        <p>
          A common lead up to a big loss is when you start with a
          larger loss than normal (e.g. 1 to 2 std deviations from normal),
          and your risk increases to make up for the loss.  If the
          trade fails, you have an even larger loss, which can further
          increase risk taking, and potentially further the losses
          much more.<br>
          Having three losses in a row is not terrible or too
          surprising, but if they are magnified 2x, 5x or 10x, it's
          unlikely that normal size trades will be impactful (if
          profitable) for 2x, 5x or 10x or longer.  In
          other words, it takes much more wall
          time trading at normal size to make up for the loss.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
	<H3>Trading the news</H3><br>
	Markets move on material news.  Part of the job of
	a human trader is to be present when news is scheduled and
	interpret it along with the market reaction.
	This might include corporate earnings reports, inflation data, jobs
	reports, FED announcements, etc.  If you're unaware of scheduled
	news, you might be in the middle of a trade and get blown out of it due to important
	news moving the market.  You'd add to your risk	unnecessarily
	if you're not following the news.
      </li>

    </ul>

    <H2>Forms of Fear</H2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <H3>Taking a loss</H3><br>
        A symptom of not wanting to be wrong is a fear of and refusal
        to take a loss.  Taking a loss is painful, and new traders
        tend to desperately avoid pain.  As long as the trader is
        still in the trade, they might think to themselves that they
        haven't lost yet even while the chances of not losing anything
        is slipping further and further away.  New traders might hold
        the position open so long that when they finally do sell, it's
        a catastrophic loss.  It's better to learn to lose and figure
        out how to lose less often and lose smaller amounts.  If a new
        trader loses small, they have a chance to debug the trade(s)
        and try again, vs spending all your chances gripped in fear of
        taking a loss.
      </li>

      <li>
        <H3>Being wrong</H3>
        Being wrong challenges the ego, which can be difficult to
        overcome.  How will I think of myself, and how will others
        think of me if I lose on this trade.  So by holding a losing
        (odds against) trade, hoping for a turnaround, a trader hopes to avoid the
        embarrassment of feeling wrong.
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <H3>Missing out (FOMO)</H3><br>
	FOMO appears when it looks as though an opportunity will be
	missed, so you act out of emotion to reduce the
	stress/tension of missing out rather than considering the
	risks/rewards of the action.  FOMO plays off a sense of
	scarcity.  You'll find the phenomena exploited
	by 'once in a lifetime offers' and 'special deals' in stores,
	which tend to get people to act now.  With stocks, it tends to
	occur around large moves up or down in price.  If buying on
	the way up, often the reward of an even higher price is in
	sight, but the underlying risk of liquidity
	at the current prices drying up may be dimly in view.
