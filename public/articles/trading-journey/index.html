      This is a story about the lessons learned as I began intraday trading.

    <H2>Lessons learned</H2>
    <ul>

      <li>
	<b>Emotions</b><br>
	Trading to support a person's livelihood involves the gain and loss of meaningful amounts
	of money.  When a trade is placed and meaningful amounts of
	money can be gained or lost, traders can be susceptible to swings in
	emotion.  Swings in emotions tend to create biases unrelated
	to the underlying information in the market.<br>The risk with gains is an emotional bias of
	overconfidence with the implied assumption
	that the good market conditions will continue.  This can
	result in overbetting just when good conditions
	are plateuing and starting to recede.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Greed</b><br>
	When a trader starts out profitable enough on the day to stop trading,
	emotions like greed tempt traders to continue trading.  Greed
	also crops up when a trader starts out with a loss and will
	not accept the pain of taking a loss on the day and continues
	to trade no matter the conditions.  The
	naive idea being that the trading is profitable and so the
	more trading, the more profits will be made.  This is incorrect
	due to decision fatigue explained below and market conditions.
	Quality trading decisions are finite and low quality
	decisions made later in the day tend to result in less
	profit.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Decision fatigue</b><br>
	Humans lose their ability to make good decisions as the number
	of decisions increases throughout a day due to mental fatigue. Trading involves
	making decisions such as whether a good
	setup to buy or sell is present.   As the number of trading
	decisions made per day increases, fatigue sets in, trades
	tend to become more inconsistent and sloppy.
