    <H2>Why trading</H2>
    <ul>
      <li>
	<H3>Direct imediate market feedback</H3>
	I've worked jobs where your work is not judged by the market,
	but instead a bureaucracy.  It's hard to know if what you're
	doing is good, bad or of value.  The public markets on the
	other hand give imediate feedback in the form of trading gains/losses.
      </li>
      <li>
	<H3>Closer to the truth</H3>
	Markets can be irational, but a well run market tends toward the truth over
	time.  I'd like to help push the markets toward the truth, with
	the best information I can find and best analysis I can make.

	My first foray into markets was learning a principalled value
	investing approach as a touchstone to the true value of an
	asset.  I want to delve deeper now and learn about short term
	market manias.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <H2>Lessons learned</H2>
    <p>
      This is a story about the lessons learned as I began intraday trading.
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
	<H3>Emotions</H3><br>
	Trading to support a person's livelihood involves the gain and loss of meaningful amounts
	of money.  When a trade is placed and meaningful amounts of
	money can be gained or lost, traders can be susceptible to swings in
	emotion.  Swings in emotions tend to create biases unrelated
	to the underlying information in the market.<br>The risk with gains is an emotional bias of
	overconfidence with the implied assumption
	that the good market conditions will continue.  This can
	result in overbetting just when good conditions
	are plateuing and starting to recede.
      </li>
      <li>
        <H3>Greed</H3><br>
	When a trader starts out profitable enough on the day to stop trading,
	emotions like greed tempt traders to continue trading.  Greed
	also crops up when a trader starts out with a loss and will
	not accept the pain of taking a loss on the day and continues
	to trade no matter the conditions.  The
	naive idea being that the trading is profitable and so the
	more trading, the more profits will be made.  This is incorrect
	due to decision fatigue explained below and market conditions.
	Quality trading decisions are finite and low quality
	decisions made later in the day tend to result in less
	profit.
      </li>
      <li>
        <H3>Decision fatigue</H3><br>
	Humans lose their ability to make good decisions as the number
	of decisions increases throughout a day due to mental fatigue. Trading involves
	making decisions such as whether a good
	setup to buy or sell is present.   As the number of trading
	decisions made per day increases, fatigue sets in, trades
	tend to become more inconsistent and sloppy.
      </li>

      <li>
        <H3>Learning the setups</H3><br>
        Traders have a lingua franca regarding common states of the market that
        are refered to as setups, plays or market events. Some common setups are
        symetric triangles, gap-n-go, bull flag, bear flag, etc...
        It's worth learning these to get an idea of stereotypical
        concluding moves or outcomes (i.e. resolutions).
      </li>

      <li>
        <H3>Avoiding the big loss</H3><br>
        Beginner traders may have periods of consistent profits, but
        due to a hole in their trading plan, give up profits with a
        big loss.  The big losses tend to stem from
        emotional decision making, rather than sticking to a planned
        exit.  Ocassionally fat fingering (mistakenly placing or
        leaving an order) is the cause, though these are perhaps 1 in 20
        or 1 in 50 events vs. emotional trades.  The emotion tends to
        be a fear of being wrong, fear of taking a loss, or clinging
        to a bias.
      </li>

      <li>
	<H3>Trading the news</H3><br>
	Markets move on material news.  Part of the job of
	a human trader is to be present when news is scheduled and
	interpret it along with the market reaction.
	This might include corporate earnings reports, inflation data, jobs
	reports, FED announcements, etc.  If you're unaware of scheduled
	news, you might be in the middle of a trade and get blown out of it due to important
	news moving the market.  You'd add to your risk	unnecessarily
	if you're not following the news.
    </ul>

    <H2>Forms of Fear</H2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <H3>Taking a loss</H3><br>
        A symptom of not wating to be wrong is a fear of and refusal
        to take a loss.  Taking a loss is painful, and new traders
        tend to desperately avoid pain.  As long as the trader is
        still in the trade, they might think to themselves that they
        haven't lost yet even while the chances of not losing anything
        is slipping further and further away.  New traders might hold
        the position open so long that when they finally do sell, it's
        a catastrophic loss.  It's better to learn to lose and figure
        out how to lose less often and lose smaller amounts.  If a new
        trader loses small, they have a chance to debug the trade(s)
        and try again, vs spending all your chances gripped in fear of
        taking a loss.
      </li>

      <li>
        <H3>Being wrong</H3>
        Being wrong challenges the ego, which can be difficult to
        overcome.  How will I think of myself, and how will others
        think of me if I lose on this trade.  So by holding a losing
        (odds against) trade, hoping for a turnaround, a trader hopes to avoid the
        embaresment of feeling wrong.
