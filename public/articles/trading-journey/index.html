      This is a story about the lessons learned as I began intraday trading.
    </p>
    <H2>Lessons learned</H2>
    <ul>
      <li>
	
        <b>Decision Fatigue and over trading:</b><br>
	Humans lose their ability to make good decisions as the number
	of decisions increases throughout a day. Trading involves
	making decisions such as whether it's a good
	situation to buy or sell.   So the more trading
	decisions that are made per day, the lower quality the trading
	decisions become.  As fatigue sets in, trades become more
	inconsistent and sloppy.  
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Greed:</b><br>
	When a trader starts out profitable enough on the day to stop trading,
	emotions like greed tempt traders to continue trading.  The
	naive idea being that the trading is profitable and so the
	more trading, the more profits will bemade.  This is incorrect
	due to decision fatigue explained above.
	Quality trading decisions are finite and lower the quality
	decisions made later in the day almostalway results in less
	profit.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b>Emotions whil trading:</b><br>
	Real trading involves the gain and loss of meaningful amounts
	of money.  When a trade is placed and meaningful amounts of
	money can be lost, traders can be susceptible to swings in
	emotion.
