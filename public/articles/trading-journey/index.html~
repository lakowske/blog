    <ul>
      <li>
	
        <b>Decision Fatigue and over trading:</b>
	Trading involves making decisions such as whether it's a good
	situation to buy or sell. Humans lose their ability to make good decisions as the number
	of decisions increases throughout a day.  So the more trading
	decisions that are made per day, the lower quality the trading
	decisions become.  As fatigue sets in, trades become more
	inconsistent and sloppy.  
      </li>

        <b>Kubectl:</b>
        Follow the instructions at <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/">Installing
        and Setting up kubectl</a> to install kubectl.  kubectl is the general
        purpose CLI client for inspecting and manipulating a kubernetes cluster.
