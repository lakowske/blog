   <p>I completed the inaugural ml-class.org course! I was interested in online courses and honing my machine learning skills, so I took the course. It was a success. Here is my&nbsp;<a href="http://sethlakowske.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ml-statement-of-accomplishment.pdf">statement of accomplishment</a>. I learned that online courses have advantages that my college courses lacked. The ability to recall, replay and test on lectures in a user friendly manner. The shared experience of other students enrolled in the course, again stored away for convenient recall. I also became familiar with new algorithms such as PCA and large scale machine learning. Iâ€™d recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about machine learning .</p>
