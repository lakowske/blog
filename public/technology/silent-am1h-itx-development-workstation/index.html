  <h2>Silent AM1H-ITX Development Workstation</h2>

   <p>I purchased an AM1H-ITX motherboard 2 weeks ago to replace the old tower under my desk. &nbsp;My old tower is a 6 core AMD with a GTX-260 video card. &nbsp;It still performs well on CPU intensive tasks and many games, but these days I don’t play many games nor do I run CPU intensive tasks. &nbsp;It consumes over 100 watts of power all day and makes quite a bit of noise doing…pretty much nothing. &nbsp;My old tower is overpowered for the job.</p> 
   <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/oldtower.jpeg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-281 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/oldtower.jpeg" alt="oldtower" width="326" height="244"></a></p> 
   <p>These days I surf the web and edit code in Emacs. &nbsp;Both are light workloads. &nbsp;For these tasks, I want a computer that sips power and is silent, but still powerful enough to play video and it would be really nice if it’s not too expensive. &nbsp;I found these qualities in the AM1H-ITX. &nbsp;I ended up putting together this beauty.</p> 
   <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AM1H-TOP.jpeg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-282 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AM1H-TOP.jpeg" alt="AM1H-TOP" width="326" height="244"></a></p> 
   <p>The first thing to notice is the power supply. &nbsp;It is a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I5ERUW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B004I5ERUW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=inforgain-20&amp;linkId=B6OR2VKEUEI5HPIT">Universal AC Adapter 70W</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=inforgain-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B004I5ERUW" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0">&nbsp;I bought at Amazon for $11.70. &nbsp;The AM1H-ITX has a DC barrel jack in the ba<img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=inforgain-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B004I5ERUW" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0">ck that you can see on the corner of the motherboard in the picture below. &nbsp;I set the power supply to 19 volts and I was up and running. &nbsp;The motherboard hooks directly into the power supply. &nbsp;This saved me from purchasing a $30 pico psu!</p> 
   <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AM1H-BOTTOM.jpeg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-283 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AM1H-BOTTOM.jpeg" alt="AM1H-BOTTOM" width="326" height="244"></a></p> 
   <p>The CPU is a 2.05 GHz quad core AMD 5350 rated at 25 watts. &nbsp;I have 16 GBs of ram plugged in and two ~256 GB SSDs. &nbsp;The CPU fan is set to not run until a certain temperature is reached. &nbsp;Mine is set to not run until the temperature is over 140 degrees Fahrenheit, which means the fan is almost never running.</p> 
   <h3>Linux</h3> 
   <p>The only downside so far has been the video drivers support under Linux. &nbsp;Without AMDs video drivers, I wasn’t able to configure dual monitor support. &nbsp;Maybe someone with better xorg.conf skills could figure out how to get the free drivers working, but I was left with the AMD catalyst drivers. &nbsp;The drivers didn’t work on Debian, so I had to switch to Ubuntu to get video on both monitors.</p> 
   <h3>Power Savings</h3> 
   <p>The AM1H-ITX uses only 22 watts at idle. &nbsp; My old computer consumed 122 watts at idle. &nbsp;At 12 cents per killowatt hour, this saves me $105.12 per year.</p> 
   <h3>Conclusion</h3> 
   <p>The AM1H-ITX sips power and can run silent. It is powerful enough to play video and it cost $122 for the motherboard, CPU and power supply. &nbsp;So far I am really enjoying the silence, the savings on my power bill and the smaller environmental footprint.</p>
