   <p>I successfully completed the course Think Again: How to reason and argue. It went well. 
    The course contains reasoning techniques useful to situations such as: 
    buying a car, selecting a politician, evaluating a religion and choosing a course of action. 
    The course teaches students how to model these types of situations and soundly reason about them. 
    I <a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/get_certificate.pdf">completed the course with distinction</a>.
